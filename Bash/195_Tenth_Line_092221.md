Given a text file file.txt, print just the 10th line of the file.

Example:

Assume that file.txt has the following content:
```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
```
Your script should output the tenth line, which is:
```
Line 10
```
Note:
1. If the file contains less than 10 lines, what should you output?
2. There's at least three different solutions. Try to explore all possibilities.

Solution1(0 ms):
```
awk '{NR==10}' file.txt
```
Solution2(4 ms):
```
sed -n 10p file.txt
```
Solution3(RunTime Error):
```
tail -n+10 file.txt|head-1
```
Solution4(4 ms):
```
awk 'FNR==10 {print}' file.txt

```
