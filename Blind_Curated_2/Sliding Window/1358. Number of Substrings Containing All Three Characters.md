Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

Constraints:
```
3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4
```
s only consists of a, b or c characters.

Solution:
```
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        res, last = 0, [-1] * 3
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            last[ord(c) - 97] = i
            res += 1 + min(last)
        return res

# TC: O(n)
# SC: O(1)
